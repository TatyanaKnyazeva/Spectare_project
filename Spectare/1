animation
Heart-warmig, beautiful, thought-provoking?
heartwarming
Tokyo Godfathers. The story of three homeless people who find a newborn baby while foraging through trash on Christmas eve and decide to care for the baby and track down its parents.
beautiful
Wolf Children. The story offers a realistic yet ultimately forgiving view of maternity, and growing up in general. 
thoughtprovoking
Waking Life. The discussions revolve around issues such as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy or the meaning of life.
horror
Gripping, violent, mysterious?
gripping
It Follows. A genuinely creepy film that’s also very smart.
violent
Green Room. The basic premise: a lefty punk band winds up taking a show at a skinhead club because they are desperate for cash. The show goes well, but afterward the band accidentally witnesses something they shouldn’t have and are trapped in the club’s green room.
mysterious
Bone Tomahawk. The suspect is a faraway tribe known for its cannibalism practices, the movie follows the sheriff as he leads an expedition to save a disappearing woman.
scifi
Weird, original, emotional?
weird
The Fountain. Highly compelling science-fiction/fantasy film told in three interwoven parts related to the mythical concept of the Tree of Life.
original
The Science of Sleep. Bizarre and whimsical dream sequences follow and a sweet, if hesitant, love story unfolds. 
emotional
Beasts of the Southern Wild. Poetic and phantasmagorical, yet as grounded as a documentary, it’s a tale told through the eyes of a young girl living in extreme poverty just beyond the bounds of civilization. 
action
Absorbing, no-brainer, smart?
smart
Serenity. The story revolves around the captain (Nathan Fillion) and crew of the titular space vessel that operate as space outlaws, running cargo and smuggling missions throughout the galaxy. 
nobrainer
Hot Fuzz. An obscenely funny flick that has an intriguing plot and an even greater set of characters.
absorbing
Sicario. It’s intense, intelligent and very realistic in its approach to action sequences. 
comedy
Up-lifting, well-acted, warm?
uplifting
50/50. In a movie that comes closer to a believable real life situation than most, 50/50 manages to mine humor, pathos and simple honesty from a dark and traditional situation. 
wellacted
Strictly Ballroom. An energetic, fun and hilarious movie.
warm
Up in the Air. Ryan Bingham enjoys living out of a suitcase for his job, travelling around the country firing people, but finds that lifestyle threatened by the presence of a potential love interest, and a new hire.
documentary
Charming, inspiring, slow?
